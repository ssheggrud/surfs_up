# surfs_up
Analyzing weather data using Python, VS Code, and Jupyter Notebook

# Overview of Analysis

The analysis of weather data is to see if a Surf and Shake shop in Hawaii would be a viable business model. An investor is interested but due to having been burned by a previous opportunity, he wants an analysis of weather patterns. The analysis we provide will show him the viability of the project.

# Results

The first look at June tells us that there were 1700 measurements taken and the highest temperature recorded was 85, the lowest was 64, with the average being 74.9. The temperature deviation is 3.26 (rounded up). A low deviation like this tells us that the temperatures tend to be close to the mean/average.

Moving to the December data, we can see that 1517 measurements taken, giving us a slightly smaller dataset (roughly 11% smaller) to work with. The high was 83 and the low was 56, with an average of 71.

Looking at the data I can draw three conclusions:
* The temperature deviation for June is 3.26 (rounded up). A low deviation like this tells us that the temperatures tend to be close to the average. December's deviation is 3.75 (rounded up), which again highlights that the overal temperatures tend to be close to the average.
* Looking at the overal temperatures, you can see that they are fairly similar. This lets us know that seasonal temperature changes shouldn't adversely affect the proposed business model. Even the deviations are very close, having only 0.49 between them.
* With June and December having similar high temperatures, one can draw the conclusion that people would be interested in buying ice cream to combat heat as well as wanting to be in the water to cool off.

# Conclusion

The data is useful in as far as it tells us what previous temperatures have been. However, a more complete analysis would include weather conditions, because rainy days could impact a tourist's desire to surf or get ice cream. I would also like to narrow the temperature to daytime vs nighttime temperatures. Some of the lower temperatures could be during the times when the business would be closed and have a lesser impact. I'd like to see inclusion of data showing the times tourists are more interested in surfing. This would help shape the prime hours of operation.
